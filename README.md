# Russian Trolls, Pols and Approval Rate

# Abstract
The outcome of the 2016 US election were a surprise, few experts predicted a Trump win. Since then, it has been revealed that the Russian might have had an influence on the election through their action on social media. To test this claim, we will compare the IRA dataset and the "2016 Elections Poll". Moreover, the scope of the tweets dataset does no stop to the election. The dataset was last updated on March 2018, so we can also draw insights from the current presidency. We want to compare this with historical approval rates of Obama, since the trolls date all the way back from 2012. Is there a correlation between the russian tweets and the approval raitings ?


# Research questions
We want to start by defining the classes: what are the words associated with "RightTroll" or "LeftTroll". What is a typical right/left toll? Is there any influence of emojis on popularity ? Then we want to analyse the different effect of tweets authors and hashtags. Are there more influential trolls on the public opinion? It would also be interesting to see how that correlates with news coverage and political events. Is the tweet density related to actual events?

# Dataset
We will use the IRA dataset given in the course.
We will use two additionals datasets from FiveThirtyEight: "2016 Election Poll" (https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/datasets) and "Trump Approval Rates" (https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?ex_cid=rrpromo)

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
* **By the 11th of November:** Filter/clean tweets (Non english) and select relevant ones (politically involved). Group the tweets by time period. Filter/Clean approvals rate: selecting Trump presidency. Filter/Clean 2016 election poll dataset. 

* **By the 18th of November:** Descriptive analysis on all datasets. Relevant features extraction on all dataset. And highlight dataset interactions (mostly on based on time relations). 
Look for political events during the timespan (to maybe find a correlation with the tweets themes)

* **By the 25th of November:** Clear project plan for the data story. Complete descriptive analysis.
