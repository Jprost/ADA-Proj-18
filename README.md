# Abstract
The motivations behind our research is highlighting the complex relations between food, wealth, education and obesity rate. By looking into the Open Food Fact Database, we can have information about the type of food, their content and nutritive value for different countries. Based on those values, we want to extract country-specific type of food. Simultaneously, we will compare these features with obesity rate, education and GDP per capita. Our goal is to understand whether wealthier countries tend to eat more healthily. Does a healthier diet correlates with a higher education level. We also want to highlight food trends, globally and per country: Is the number of vegan food increasing? Is the quantity of palm oil products decreasing?
Even though the open food fact database only include the date a product was added to the database, we believe it gives an estimation of the time evolution of the trends as well. If this assumption holds true, we will do the mentioned above analysis over time.

# Research questions
We will assume that the open food fact database provides a good overview a country food scene. We will need to define what is a good meal. We want to understand if countries differ by food type and ingredients? Do countries have different average nutritive value?  To validate our hypothesis, we will analyse t
How does quantity of healthy food correlates with wealth? How does quantity of healthy food correlates with education? 

# Dataset
We will use the Open Food Fact dataset (https://world.openfoodfacts.org/)
We will enrich it with obesity rates from (https://knoema.fr/WHOGDOBMIMay/who-global-database-on-body-mass-index-bmi)
Education data and GDP per capita data from The World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/topic/education - https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD )
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.
